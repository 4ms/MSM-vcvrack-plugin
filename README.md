## Random Source v1

A good general tutorial on how to use S&H modules:

"Sample" knob is a volume control for the Sample input.

## Random Source v2  

This modules doesnt need additional modules to work.   
"Sample" knob is a volume control for the Sample input.  
"Tempo" knob controls the frequency(speed) of the build in LFO.  
"FM" knob for frequency modulation of the LFO.  
Inputs: Sample, FM, Ext Clock  
Outputs: S&H, Square LFO

## Mult  
  
This multiplier got 3x 2 inputs and 3x 6 outputs.  
With the +/- switches you can decide whether the two incoming signals are either added or subtracted from each other.

## SwitchedMult

This multiplier got 8 inputs and 8 outputs.  
Inputs will be multiplied by each other unless muted or no signal.  
Every input got a mute switch and a 1or2 switch.  
  
Inputs 1-4 will regulary go to Output 1-4  
Inputs 5-8 will regulary go to Output 5-8  
2or4 Switch: This switch lets you choose between 4 outs or 8 outs.
