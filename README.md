## VCV Rack Modules by MSM:  
  
  
## Random Source v1

A good general tutorial on how to use S&H modules:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9auf7dpMrU  
  
"Sample" knob is a volume control for the Sample input.

## Random Source v2  

This modules doesnt need additional modules to work.   
"Sample" knob is a volume control for the Sample input.  
"Tempo" knob controls the frequency(speed) of the build in LFO.  
"FM" knob for frequency modulation of the LFO.  
Inputs: Sample, FM, Ext Clock  
Outputs: S&H, Square LFO

## Mult  
  
This multiplier got 3x 2 inputs and 3x 6 outputs.  
With the +/- switches you can decide whether the two incoming signals are either added or subtracted from each other.

## SwitchedMult

This multiplier got 8 inputs and 8 outputs.  
Every Input can be muted (Switch or CV).
  
Inputs 1-2 will added by each other and send to the Outputs 1-2.  
Inputs 3-4 will added by each other and send to the Outputs 3-4.  
Inputs 5-6 will added by each other and send to the Outputs 5-6.  
Inputs 7-8 will added by each other and send to the Outputs 7-8.  

Inputs 3-4(7-8) can also be sent to the Outputs 1-2(5-6) with the  
"2or4" Switch (CV or Switch) which lets you choose between 2 outs or 4 outs.

## Fade

Fade is a fairly simple crossfader module.
  
Knob A controls the mix of Inputs 1-2.  
Knob B controls the mix of Inputs 3-4.  
knob AB controls the mix between Knob A and B.
  
Every Knob can be control via CV inputs (CV A, CV B, CV AB).  
This module got 3 Outputs: Mix A, Mix B and Mix AB
