VCV Rack Modules: 


Random Source

A good general tutorial on how to use S&H modules:

Knobs: 
"Sample" is a Volume/Range knob for the Sample input.
The smaller one controls the incoming signal from the CV input.

INFO:
The Random Source module works in its current status but is still a work in progress.
Therefor it will be changed (e.g. CV input will be deleted in a future release)
