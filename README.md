Random Source v2

This modules doesnt need additional modules to work. 

"Sample" knob is a volume control for the Sample input.

"Tempo" knob controls the frequency(speed) of the build in LFO.

"FM" knob for frequency modulation of the LFO.

Inputs: Sample, FM, Ext Clock

Outputs: S&H, Square LFO

Mult

This multiplier got 3x 2 inputs and 3x 6 outputs.
With the +/- switches you can decide whether the two incoming signals are either added or subtracted from each other.

SwitchedMult

This multiplier got 8 inputs and 8 outputs.
Inputs will be multiplied by each other unless muted or no signal.
Every input got a mute switch and a 1or2 switch.

input 1-4 will regulary go to output 1-4
input 5-8 will regulary go to ouput 5-8
1or2 switch: This switch lets you choose between 4 outs or 8 outs.
